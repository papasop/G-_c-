Where:
- `t*` is the resonance point extracted from real LIGO strain data via a fitted damped oscillation model;
- `φ_c(t)` is a collapse-based structural function (e.g., `sech²` or Gaussian);
- `φ² = H · φ_c` supports the emergence of the fine-structure constant α when `H ≈ 137.036`.

All analysis follows a **collapse-only** framework, avoiding any empirical tuning to known constants.
